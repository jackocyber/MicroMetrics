(a)

i) Estimating college enrollment.

ii) Estimate the impact of unions on business survival, employment levels,
output, productivity, and wages.

iii) Estimating housing prices as a measure for willingness to pay for
clean air.

(b) 

i) PSAT score is the forcing variable. This tracks because it is continuous and can
be assumed to be random at the cutoff it works well as a forcing
variable for RD.

ii) Voting percentage is the forcing variable, and because voting percentage
is continuous and can simulate an random assignment of treatment and control the cutoff
of 51%.

iii) Total Suspended Particles(TSP’s). The amount of pollution in the air is a continuous variable which simulates random around the cutoff it does work well as an RD variable.

(c) 

i) Financial aid because students above the
cutoff on the PSAT score are more likely to get financial aid, and
financial aid is likely to give a large incentive for students to go to college, it is
a treatment variable. There is a well defined cut off so this is a sharp RDD design.

ii) Unionization because companies above
the cutoff are unionized and unions lead to higher bargaining
power of workers. There is a well defined cut off so this is a sharp RDD design.

iii) Federally regulated pollution because counties above the cutoff of TSP are regulated according
to their emissions which impacts housing prices, it is the treatment
variable. The treatment variable can be affected so this is a fuzzy RDD design and we need IV to correct the bias.

(d)

i) Because financial aid is such an important factor in college enrollment,
we want to measure its specific effect. The effects should be continuous
as students scoring above and below the cutoff close to the cutoff should be pretty similar in ability IQ and motivation. Therefore because we expect such
a difference to be attributable to this cutoff we want to use RDD
instead of SLR.

ii) Because unionization has a distinct cutoff and other effects should
be continuous between different companies. Therefore we should use RDD instead
of SLR.

iii) Total Suspended Particles(TSP’s) because
amount of pollution in the air is a continuous variable which is as good as random
around the cutoff it works well as a RD variable.
