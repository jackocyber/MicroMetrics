  Estimating college enrollment.
\item
  Estimate the impact of unions on business survival, employment levels,
  output, productivity, and wages.
\item
  Estimating housing prices as a measure for willingness to pay for
  clean air.

\item
  PSAT score is the forcing variable. This tracks because it is
  continuous and can be assumed to be random at the cutoff it works well
  as a forcing variable for RD.
\item
  Voting percentage is the forcing variable, and because voting
  percentage is continuous and can simulate an random assignment of
  treatment and control the cutoff of 51\%.
\item
  Total Suspended Particles(TSP's). The amount of pollution in the air
  is a continuous variable which simulates random around the cutoff it
  does work well as an RD variable.
\end{enumerate}

\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi})}
\item
  Financial aid because students above the cutoff on the PSAT score are
  more likely to get financial aid, and financial aid is likely to give
  a large incentive for students to go to college, it is a treatment
  variable. There is a well defined cut off so this is a sharp RDD
  design.
\item
  Unionization because companies above the cutoff are unionized and
  unions lead to higher bargaining power of workers. There is a well
  defined cut off so this is a sharp RDD design.
\item
  Federally regulated pollution because counties above the cutoff of TSP
  are regulated according to their emissions which impacts housing
  prices, it is the treatment variable. The treatment variable can be
  affected so this is a fuzzy RDD design and we need IV to correct the
  bias.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi})}
\item
  Because financial aid is such an important factor in college
  enrollment, we want to measure its specific effect. The effects should
  be continuous as students scoring above and below the cutoff close to
  the cutoff should be pretty similar in ability IQ and motivation.
  Therefore because we expect such a difference to be attributable to
  this cutoff we want to use RDD instead of SLR.
\item
  Because unionization has a distinct cutoff and other effects should be
  continuous between different companies. Therefore we should use RDD
  instead of SLR.
\item
  Total Suspended Particles(TSP's) because amount of pollution in the
  air is a continuous variable which is as good as random around the
  cutoff it works well as a RD variable.
\end{enumerate}
